<p><em>Inundated distance </em>is the distance (in km) between Old Maun Bridge (Cresta Lodge bridge) and the front of flood on the Boteti River. For reference - the inlet to lake Xao is almost exactly at the 400km mark. This output generated a single time series of monthly values, covering the entire period of simulations. Data do not include spinup years (if any).
