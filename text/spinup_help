<p><em>Spinup</em> or a "warm-up" period is a period over which the model is run to allow "equilibriation" of conditions within the model. A spinup run might be necessary if model is initialized from conditions that are not in equilibrium with inputs. You can read more about the initial conditions and model equilibrium here.
<p>Spinup simulation is optional, i.e. it does not have to be implemented. It will not be implemented if spinup field has the value of 0. In any other case - a specified number of years (maximum possible value is 5, though) will be taken as model spinup period.
<p>The spinup model simulation is simply done by using the first year of input data and running model with these inputs for the specified number of times. After that, the state variables of the model (storages in each of the units) are used as a "new" initial condition for model simulation with the entire time series of inputs. Importantly, the spinup years are not reported in the output files.
